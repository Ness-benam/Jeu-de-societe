# Jeu-de-societe
#We can choose either a math game or a game with dice.
#Mathematical choice: choice of probability or pascal triangle.
#Probability:the user enters the number of digits to insert and then the digits one by one.
#Pascal's Traingle: the user enters the height of the triangle and / or the size of the Stern sequence.
#The choice of dice: The user clicks on "roll dice" to obtain random cards.
#If the user runs into the bad guy, the score goes back to zero and the hand passes to the other user.
#the user has to click on "hold" to maintain your current score to update the total score.
#the first player to reach 200 points or more will be the winner and the game ends.
